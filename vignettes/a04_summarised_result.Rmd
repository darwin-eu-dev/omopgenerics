A summarised result is a table that contains aggregated summary statistics (that is, a result set that contains no patient-level data). The table with a summarised result contains the following columns (although there can be additional ones):

## Additional attributes
### Extra aggregated results
A summarised result may also contain other aggregated results as attributes of the main result.

### Participants
A summarised result may, as an optional attribute, contain a reference to the patients that informed the result. The participants will contain a "subject_id" column which can be used to identify individuals in the person table (or other tables in the cdm reference).
