A cdm reference is a single R object that represents OMOP CDM data. The tables in the cdm reference may be in a database, but a cdm reference may also contain OMOP CDM tables that are in dataframes or tibbles, or in arrow. In the latter cases the cdm reference would typically be a subset of an original cdm reference that has been derived as part of a particular analysis.

OMOPGenerics provides a general class definition a cdm reference and a dataframe/ tibble implementation. For creating a cdm reference using a database, see the CDMConnector package (<https://darwin-eu.github.io/CDMConnector/>).

A cdm reference is a list of tables. These tables come in three types: standard OMOP CDM tables, cohort tables, and other auxiliary tables.

### 1) Standard OMOP CDM tables

There are multiple versions of the OMOP CDM. The list of tables included in version 5.3 are as follows.

```{r}
library(OMOPGenerics)
omopTables()
```

The standard OMOP tables have required fields. We can check the required column of the person table, for example, like so 
```{r}
requiredTableColumns(table = "person")
```

-   Cohort tables (see `generatedCohortSet`).

-   Other tables, these other tables can have any format.

Any table to be part of a cdm object has to fulfill 4 conditions:

-   All must share a common source.

-   The name of the tables must be lowercase.

-   The name of the column names of each table must be lowercase.

-   `person` and `observation_period` must be present.

### Required columns

```{r, echo = FALSE}
version = "5.3"
mes <- cli::col_green(cli::style_bold("OMOP CDM version: \"{version}\""))
for (tab in c("person", "observation_period")) {
  mes <- c(
    mes, 
    "*" = paste0(
      cli::col_blue(cli::style_bold(tab)), ": ", paste0(
        requiredTableColumns(table = tab, version = version), collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
tables <- omopTables(version = version)
tables <- sort(tables[!tables %in% c("person", "observation_period")])
for (tab in tables) {
  mes <- c(
    mes, 
    "*" = paste0(
      cli::col_blue(tab), ": ", paste0(
        requiredTableColumns(table = tab, version = version), collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
cli::cli_inform(mes)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
version = "5.4"
mes <- cli::col_green(cli::style_bold("OMOP CDM version: \"{version}\""))
for (tab in c("person", "observation_period")) {
  mes <- c(
    mes, 
    "*" = paste0(
      cli::col_blue(cli::style_bold(tab)), ": ", paste0(
        requiredTableColumns(table = tab, version = version), collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
tables <- omopTables(version = version)
tables <- sort(tables[!tables %in% c("person", "observation_period")])
for (tab in tables) {
  mes <- c(
    mes, 
    "*" = paste0(
      cli::col_blue(tab), ": ", paste0(
        requiredTableColumns(table = tab, version = version), collapse = ", "
      )
    )
  )
}
cli::cli_inform(mes)
```


### 2) Cohort tables

Studies using the OMOP CDM often create study-specific cohort tables. We also consider these as part of the cdm reference once created. Each cohort table is associated with a specific class of its own, a `generatedCohortSet`, which is described more in a subsequent vignette. As with the standard OMOP CDM tables, cohort tables are expected to contain a specific set of fields (with no restriction placed on whether they include additional fields or not).

```{r}
requiredCohortColumns(table = "cohort", version = "5.3")
requiredCohortColumns(table = "cohort_set", version = "5.3")
requiredCohortColumns(table = "cohort_attrition", version = "5.3")
```

### 3) Achilles result tables

The Achilles R package provides descriptive statistics on an OMOP CDM database. The results from Achilles are stored in tables in the database. The following tables are created with the given columns.

```{r}
achillesTables()
requiredAchillesColumns("achilles_analysis")
requiredAchillesColumns("achilles_results")
requiredAchillesColumns("achilles_results_dist")
```

### 4) Other tables

Beyond the standard OMOP CDM tables and cohort tables, additional tables can be added to the cdm reference. These tables could, for example, be OMOP extension/ expansion tables or extra tables containing data required to perform a study but not normally included as part of the OMOP CDM. These tables could contain any set of fields.

## General rules for a cdm reference

Any table to be part of a cdm object has to fulfill the following conditions:

-   All tables must share a common source (that is, a mix of tables in the database and in-memory is not permitted).

-   The name of the tables must be lower snake_case.

-   The name of the column names of each table must be lower snake_case.

-   The `person` and `observation_period` tables must be present.

-   The cdm reference must have an attribute "cdmName" that gives the name associated with the data contained there within.

## Export metadata about the cdm reference

When the export method is applied to a cdm reference, metadata about that cdm will be written to a csv. The csv contains the following columns

| Variable                               | Description                                                                                             | Datatype  | Required |
